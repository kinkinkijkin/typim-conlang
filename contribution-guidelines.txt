DEFINED PROJECT LANGUAGES:
 - English (any dialect, synthetic or natural)
 - French (French Academy for synthetic definitions, phonetic texting forms also accepted)
 - Mandarin (please phoneticize words before submitting from this language)
 - Japanese (any dialect, synthetic or natural. romaji preferred for alphabetization)
 - Russian (any dialect, synthetic or natural, as long as you can prove spelling)

reminder this list is for contributors to know which languages can be used for
translative definitions. loans can come from anywhere, as long as they can be
either translated into these languages gracefully, or enough words exist to describe
them accurately internally.



PROPER CONTRIBUTION, PER CATEGORY


Vocabulary:

Vocabulary contribution should be done in different ways depending on the origin
of words contributed, and the definability of the words directly against equivalents
from the defined project languages.
 - Words with no direct origin externally belong in dict/by-origin-vocab/no-origin
 - Words with an external origin in construction, but using words in-language,
   belong in the vocab origin file for the language the construction is from.
 - Words that are loaned by many languages that define them differently, and become
   loaned into Typim, should be discussed among community (or just kinkinkijkin, if
   no community exists) as to where they should be placed
 - Words loaned retaining source meaning which are not internationally-ambiguous
   go in the vocab origin file for the language they're from.

as well:
 - Words which can be translated losslessly to one of the defined project languages,
   which the contributor knows can be done so, should be defined in this way. If the
   community presents significant confusion about a word only defined translatively,
   a descriptive definition in Typim should be provided.
 - Words which the contributor does not know whether or not they can be defined
   translatively to a defined project language, should only be defined descriptively.
   Any word defined *only* descriptively should have a Typim description and at least
   one description in one of the defined project languages. Expect a lot of english lol


Shorthand:

Shorthand contribution should be heavily discussed with people involved before any
contribution. Shorthand goes in a "shorthand" file, under dict/ for lettering
shorthand, and under dict/by-origin-vocab/ for vocabulary shorthand.
