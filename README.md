# typim-conlang
Typist-directed auxiliary language with official shortforms, flexible grammar, and merely implied pronunciation.

## design philosophies
1) all additional complexities, intended for representing structures from native
   languages, are "optional", and used only for explicit purpose. there are a set
   of central grammar descriptions, decided to cover vague speech very easily,
   and extra grammar only exists to allow people to directly translate or to be very,
   very specific. these "extra" grammar items have specific "core" items that should
   be used instead if you think that the person you are typing to may not know what
   you're referring to already.

2) vocabulary does not have to be sourced from the "primary" languages of the project.
   these languages are only defined to say that we should provide definitions in these
   languages when possible, within the contained dictionary. words can come from any
   language a community member provides them from, or even be entirely synthetic.

3) pronunciation is not considered ever. this language is specifically designed for
   use only as a typed language. however, simple guides for pronunciation are,
   indeed, provided, and form the basis for literization of "conceptual words",
   ie words that exist in a family of spoken languages in various forms.

4) i don't like the letter n

5) any shortening of a word, compound, constituent, or sentence, should be
   reproducible with only a small degree of ambiguity, to their full form. a small
   amount of ambiguity may be acceptible, as language often concedes to context in
   order to break ambiguity anyways, and this is perfectly natural for humans to do.

6) this is a language of its community, not focussed on being a true bridge between
   all people of all cultures (hence being simply "auxiliary" without international),
   and therefore should be allowed to see bias formed by its community of speakers.

7) simply because a word is defined, does not mean it is the only word that shall
   exist for that definition. different words for the same definition, may even not
   present different implications.
