all nouns and pronouns are modified in the same way.

begin modification by supplying an apostrophe as suffix to the word, then
add all modificative suffixes in a stack. all suffixes are an open syllable.

this document is a jump straight forward from everything else defined so far intentionally

see dict/noun-extensions for a full list of these as figured so far.

example translation set:
 I am dog
   Gy komd'si ("I, doggish")
     Gy (I) komd (dog) 'si (adjectivising copula)
 My dog
   komd Gy'fw ("dog of mine")
     komd (dog) Gy (I) 'fw (adjectivising genitive)
 I am my dog
   Gy komd'si Gy'fwsi ("dog I, of mine")
     Gy (I) komd (dog) 'si (adjectivising copula) Gy (I) 'fw (adjectivising genitive) 'si (adjectivising copula with apostrophe cut to be attached to other suffix)
 My dogs
   komd'je Gy'fwje ("dogs which are mine")
     komd (dog) 'je (plural) Gy (I) 'fw (adjectivising genitive) 'je (plural, attached for adjective agreement)
 I am one of and owner of my dogs
   Gy komd'si fe bymm komd'je Gy'fwje (dog I, of they dogs of mine)
     im not breaking this one down rn lmao
 We dogs are mine and our own
   Gym komd'je Gy'fwsije + gwm'fwsije (We dogs of mine and of ours)
     also not breaking this one down rn, note the + is the correct indicator for "and"

explicit indicators of number ('je for plural and 'be for singular) must always be the last in the stack. otherwise go mad
